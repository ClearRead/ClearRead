## üîí Privacy & Data Handling

ClearRead places **privacy first** and is built to respect and protect user data:

- The extension does **not** collect, store, track, or sell any personal data, browsing history, or usage information.
- All visual adjustments (fonts, spacing, filters, reader line) are applied **locally in the user's browser** without transmitting data externally.
- When users choose to simplify text using the AI feature, the selected webpage text is **temporarily sent to the Hugging Face Inference API** solely to receive a simplified version.
- **Hugging Face Inference API does *not* store, log, track, or reuse this text.** It processes the text in real time and returns the simplified content without retaining user data.
- No user-identifiable data, metadata, or browsing history is ever shared with Hugging Face or any other third party.
- ClearRead does **not** use any data for advertising, analytics, or resale.

This approach ensures a secure, private experience while still offering advanced AI-based simplification.
